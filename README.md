# 🧠 AI Projects Hub

This repository is a collection of my **AI/ML experiments and projects** as I dive deeper into Python, data science, and machine learning.  
Most projects here are small to medium-sized — think of it as my personal sandbox for learning, prototyping, and exploring ideas.

---

## 📂 Structure
Each project lives in its own folder named after the project, for example:
- `Weather-Analyzer/`

Larger, polished projects may be split into their own repositories.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas (with plans to expand to scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.)  
- **Topics:** Data cleaning, algorithm design, basic neural networks, applied ML  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build intuition for **AI/ML fundamentals** through hands-on coding.  
- Share progress and growth as I continue EECS at UC Berkeley.  
- Eventually contribute to larger AI projects with real-world impact.
