**Project to Conslidate my Numpy basics**
Part 1: Data Simulation
Create a 1D array representing 365 days.
Use a sine function to simulate seasonal variation in temperature across the year.
Add normally distributed random noise to simulate daily fluctuations.
Combine these to create a final array of daily temperatures.

Part 2: Basic Statistics
Calculate the average temperature of the year.
Find the hottest day (max temperature and the corresponding day index).
Find the coldest day (min temperature and the corresponding day index).
Count how many days were hotter than 25°C.

Part 3: Monthly Breakdown
Trim or reshape your 1D array into a (12, 30) 2D array to approximate months.
Compute the average temperature for each of the 12 months.

Part 4: Visualization
Create a line plot of daily temperature across the year.
Add a horizontal line at 25°C to highlight hot days.
Add labels, a title, and a legend to your plot.

Stretch Goals (Optional)
Create a heatmap of the reshaped 12×30 temperature array.
Save your temperature array to a CSV file and reload it later.
Identify "heatwaves" (3+ consecutive days > 30°C).
Add a 7-day moving average line to the plot.
